# Contributing to Chapter Tracker

Thanks for helping improve Chapter Tracker. Contributions are welcome for source support, reliability, tests, accessibility, documentation, and product improvements.

## Ground rules

- Be respectful and constructive.
- Keep pull requests small and focused.
- Do not commit `.env` files, database files, API tokens, or real user data.
- Do not add code that bypasses paywalls, login requirements, CAPTCHA challenges, rate limits, robots restrictions, or other site protections.
- Prefer an official API or documented metadata feed over HTML scraping.

## Getting started

1. Fork the repository and create a branch with a clear name, such as `add-mangadex-source` or `fix-import-progress`.
2. Install backend and frontend dependencies.
3. Copy the example environment file and use local development values.
4. Make one focused change.
5. Run the relevant checks before opening a pull request.

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run build
npm test

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
npm run lint
```

## Adding a new source

Every source should be treated as an independent integration. A successful matcher alone is not enough; the latest-chapter lookup must be reliable, respectful, and tested.

### Before writing code

Confirm all of the following:

- The site allows the intended access, or has an official API suitable for it.
- Public chapter metadata is available without bypassing access controls.
- The URL format is stable enough to identify a series.
- The source has a safe request rate and a plan for temporary errors.
- You can provide representative, non-sensitive test fixtures.

### Implementation checklist

1. Add the domain and slug extractor to `backend/src/bookmark/constants/site-matchers.ts`.
2. Create a scraper in `backend/src/bookmark/scraper/`.
3. Register the scraper in `backend/src/bookmark/bookmark.service.ts`.
4. Add a conservative per-site concurrency limit.
5. Use timeouts and handle `429`, `5xx`, and malformed pages gracefully.
6. Add unit tests for URL parsing and scraper response parsing.
7. Update the supported-sources list in the frontend and README.
8. Explain the source, URL pattern, and validation steps in the pull request.

### Scraper expectations

A scraper should return only public metadata needed by the tracker:

```ts
type ScrapedChapter = {
  number: number;
  image?: string;
} | null;
```

Return `null` when a page cannot be parsed. Do not throw a whole import away because one series cannot be checked.

Use the existing Redis cache and per-site limiter. Do not increase concurrency merely to make benchmarks look better; source stability is more important than a few seconds saved.

## Areas that need help

- Import-progress UI using a job identifier plus Server-Sent Events or polling.
- Accessible mobile testing and keyboard/screen-reader improvements.
- Guest-library backup/export and a clear recovery experience.
- PostgreSQL/Neon production migration and deployment tests.
- Health-check and structured error logging.
- Source integrations that meet the rules above.
